# 3DBookFlip
<h1>A 3D Book flip effect created only with HTML5 and CSS3</h1>

I created a flip effect which uses nothing more than HTML5 and CSS3.

The code is clean written and is easy to understand.

I will add more comments later on.

Hopefully it's somehow useful, if you have critic just open up a issue and I'll look into it.
